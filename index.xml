      <description>from collections import Counter c1 = Counter(li1) c2 = Counter(li2) print(c1 &amp;amp; c2 == c1) Counter is a subcalss of Dict, therefore, from Python3.7&amp;gt;=, Counter is insertion-ordered. 2. c1 &amp;amp; c2 == c1 implies that c1 is a proper subset of c2. Dictionary is equivalent to hashmap in Java. </description>
